# Leadership MCP

### Humanist leadership delivered to your AI assistant — at the exact moment you lead.

Not in the training room. When you're about to send the hard email, give the feedback, announce the tough call.

**Leadership MCP** is a free, open-source tool that connects a living knowledge base of
**humanist leadership** to Claude (or any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)-compatible
client). When you ask for help writing a tense email, giving feedback, announcing a decision or
handling a conflict, the assistant **pauses, asks if you want it**, and — if you do — shapes the
answer from leadership principles with proven human and economic impact.

The guidance is always **a hypothesis, never a prescription**. You decide whether to listen.

---

## 🎯 The problem

Leadership doesn't happen in the training room. It happens in the interactions: the email you're
about to send, the feedback you'll give in five minutes, the announcement of a hard decision.

And it's exactly in that moment — under pressure, in a hurry — that the best leadership principle
becomes unreachable. We fall back on instinct or on corporate-speak. The good intention is there,
but the delivery escalates the conflict instead of resolving it.

Leadership training evaporates in two weeks. Leadership MCP puts the right principle **at the right
instant**, inside the tool you already use to write.

---

## ⚙️ How it works in practice

The intelligence lives in one behavioral detail: the assistant **doesn't dump theory**. It detects
that the task is relational, pauses, and offers a choice — and only then shapes the answer.

> **You:** I need to reply to an email from a colleague who's accusing me of delaying his project.
>
> **Claude:** I noticed this involves a difficult conversation with a colleague. I can consult
> Leadership MCP — a base on humanist leadership with proven guidance on how to handle this kind of
> situation — and write with that in mind. Or would you rather I just answer directly?
>
> **You:** go ahead and consult it.
>
> **Claude:** *(consults `buscar_orientacao`)* I'll start with the fact instead of the defense,
> assume good intent, and close with a concrete next step — that's what de-escalates a tense email.
> Here's the draft: …

The consultation **shapes the answer from the start** — it's not an afterthought. And the question
is asked only once: if you decline, it answers directly, without insisting.

## 🔄 What changes

| "Raw" reply (instinct under pressure) | Reply shaped by the base |
| --- | --- |
| "You didn't deliver again." | "The delivery we agreed on for Friday didn't arrive — I imagine something came up." |
| Attacks character | Describes the fact and the behavior |
| Ends on the problem | Ends on a next step: "can you give me an update by noon tomorrow?" |
| Closes the door | Opens the door for the other person to explain |

The base is organized in four chained layers — **trigger → filters → action → outcome** — that the
server assembles into a single, consolidated piece of guidance from the situation you describe:

1. **Trigger** — the relational nature of the situation (conflict, feedback, high-impact decision,
   internal relationship, external interaction).
2. **Filters** — the pillars of humanist leadership (active listening, recognition, culture of service).
3. **Action** — a concrete behavioral hypothesis for that situation.
4. **Outcome** — the expected effect (engagement, trust, inclusive culture).

---

## 👥 Who it's for

- **Leaders and managers** who run teams and make decisions that affect people.
- **Founders and entrepreneurs** building culture from day one.
- **Tech leads, PMs and coordinators** who lead without necessarily having "manager" in their title.
- **HR and people/culture** teams who want a common leadership language.
- **Anyone** who writes difficult messages at work.

No management title required. It takes leading relationships — and wanting to lead them better.

---

## ✅ What you'll accomplish

- **Handle a conflict without escalating it** — separate fact from accusation, lower the temperature.
- **Give feedback that builds** instead of hurts — and receive feedback without shutting down.
- **Announce a hard decision** (a cut, a change, extra effort) while preserving the team's trust.
- **Write the critical email** that records what's needed without setting the relationship on fire.
- **Recognize for real** — behavior, impact and feeling, not generic praise.

The end goal isn't "reply to an email better." It's building, interaction by interaction,
**engagement, trust and an inclusive culture** — the outcomes the base is after.

## 🏢 The advantage at company scale

One person using this creates real gains. An **entire team** using the **same living base** is a
different order of magnitude:

- **A common leadership language.** Everyone handles conflict, feedback and decisions from the same
  principles. Leadership quality stops depending on who happens to be whose manager.
- **A central, living base.** Updated how the company handles change? One `git push` and **everyone
  gets the new version in their next conversation** — no reinstall, no retraining, no memo.
- **Customizable to your culture.** Point the MCP to a fork with your company's values and language
  (via `LEADERSHIP_MCP_REPO` / `LEADERSHIP_MCP_REF`). The guidance now speaks the house voice.
- **Private by design.** Nothing from the conversations leaves each person's machine — the server
  only reads the public `.md` files from the repository. Distributed culture without exposing data.

Instead of training that evaporates in two weeks, humanist leadership becomes **infrastructure**:
present in every interaction, the same for everyone, and improving with a commit.

> **Run a leadership training company or consultancy?** Leadership MCP can become the continuous
> reinforcement product you offer clients — your methodology and brand, delivered at the moment the
> leader applies it. See [how to fork the base](#-technical-details) or get in touch.

## 📈 The evidence

The premise is simple and radical: **people are not resources in service of the business; the
business exists in service of people.** And it's not theory without grounding:

- At **Barry-Wehmiller**, taken to the extreme by Bob Chapman, the company grew from **$20M to
  $3.6B** over roughly 50 years — a case documented by **Harvard Business School (2016)** and
  taught at over **70 schools**.
- *"We measure success by the way we touch the lives of people."* — Bob Chapman,
  *Everybody Matters* (2015, rev. 2025).
- **Simon Sinek**, in *Leaders Eat Last*, shows why teams where people feel safe and cared for
  perform better — the leader who "eats last" builds trust.

Leadership MCP distills these principles and makes them accessible at the exact moment of the
interaction — because that's where leadership happens. Full sources are [at the end](#inspirations).

## 🚀 Installation (Claude Desktop)

Two steps: **(1)** paste the system prompt and **(2)** register the MCP server.

### 1. Paste the system prompt

Open [`prompt-sistema.md`](prompt-sistema.md), copy the content of the **Prompt** section and paste
it into Claude's custom instructions (**Settings → Profile / Custom Instructions**). It teaches the
assistant to detect relational situations and to offer — without imposing — the consultation.

### 2. Register the MCP server

> ⚠️ **Note:** this is a **local** MCP server (it runs on your machine via `npx`). It is **not**
> installed through Claude's _"Add custom connector"_ window — that's only for **remote** servers
> with an `https://` URL. The correct install is to edit the config file below. (That's why it works
> on Claude **Desktop**, not web/mobile.)

Edit the Claude Desktop config file:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

> 💡 Shortcut: **Settings → Developer → Edit Config** opens this file directly.

Add the block below (if you already have other `mcpServers`, just add the `"leadership"` entry):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "leadership": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "leadership-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then **restart Claude Desktop**. Done — ask something like *"how do I reply to an aggressive email
from a colleague?"* and watch the guidance shape the response.

## 🛠️ Technical details

<details>
<summary><strong>The MCP tools exposed to Claude</strong></summary>

<br>

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `buscar_orientacao(situacao)` | Classifies the trigger of a situation described in one sentence and returns the consolidated guidance (filters + action + outcome). |
| `listar_gatilhos()` | Returns the taxonomy of covered triggers, for navigation and transparency. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How the knowledge stays alive</strong></summary>

<br>

The server reads the base's `.md` files **directly from GitHub** each session, with a **fallback to
a bundled copy** when there's no internet:

- **Update content** → just `git push`. Users get the new version in their next conversation, no
  reinstall or restart.
- **Works offline** → without a connection, it uses the copy shipped with the package. Never breaks.
- **Private** → nothing from the conversations leaves your machine; it only fetches the public `.md`
  files from the repository.

Configurable via environment variables (optional) — this is also how a **partner or company
white-labels the base**:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LEADERSHIP_MCP_REPO` | `mcampello/leadership-mcp` | the `owner/repo` to read the base from |
| `LEADERSHIP_MCP_REF` | `main` | the branch/ref to use |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Development</strong></summary>

<br>

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run smoke        # validates classification and guidance assembly (offline)
npm run inspect      # opens the MCP Inspector to test interactively
```

Before publishing a new version:

```bash
npm run sync-knowledge   # updates the bundled copy from ../knowledge
npm publish --access public
```

## Inspirations

Created by **Mario Campello** as an open tool on **leadership + AI**. This project's vision forms at
the intersection of several sources — none of them is "the methodology"; together they inform a
practice of humanist leadership:

- **Barry-Wehmiller / Bob Chapman** — _Everybody Matters_ (2015, rev. 2025, with Raj Sisodia);
  Barry-Wehmiller University (_Listen Like a Leader_); Harvard Business School case (2016).
- **Simon Sinek** — _Leaders Eat Last_, _Start With Why_ and talks on trust, safety and purpose.
- **Mario Campello's own leadership experience and practice** — what works in the day-to-day
  reality of leading people and relationships.

Quotes and concrete data throughout the base credit their sources; the principles are expressed in
the project's own voice. This project is independent and is not affiliated with or endorsed by
Barry-Wehmiller, Bob Chapman or Simon Sinek — references are made for educational and intellectual
acknowledgment.
